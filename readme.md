## slides draft
- hindley milner
    - syntax 
    - explanation by example
    - some typing rules (maybe like 2)
    - should at least cover: 
        - (let) polymorphism
        - full type inference property
        - principle type property
- constraints
    - syntax (advanced syntax only)
    - entailment
    - term constraint system
- hm(x)
    - extended syntax
    - typing rules
- hm(r)
    - extended syntax
    - extended constraints
    - examples
- properties
    - type soundness
    - type inference
    - application in theory
    - principle constraint property
